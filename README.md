#  PyBer_Analysis Overview
V. Isualize wants a graph of the fares by city type. A summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type is used. A multiple-line graph has been created and is included in this report.

## Results
There are disparities between the urban and rural city type in terms of average fare per ride and average fare per driver.
* The urban city type has the highest number of rides but the lowest average fare per ride.
* The rural city type has the lowest number of rides and the highest average fare per ride.
* The suburban city type is in the middle with the number of rides and average fare per ride.

The multiple-line chart presents the data for the city types and fares at a glance.

## Summary
Recommendation one is to increase the fare for urban city drivers or reduce the number of drivers. Fewer drivers means more rides per drive thus a higher average fare. 
Recommendation two is to decrease the fare for rural riders. The rural drivers have a higher average fare however the fares are more expensive which may explain the lower ridership.
Recommendation three is to continue growing ridership in the suburban cities through increased ridership and minor increase in drivers. More rides per driver will get the drivers a higher average fare.
